            <p>Koly was born on 4<sup>th</sup> May, 2019 in Mexico City, Mexico. 
            She is a Beagle/Australian cattle dog mix. Her name refers to the Border Collie, 
            one of the top brightest dog breeds. Thinking more about it, it would be awesome 
            make intelligence test to mixed breed dogs because most of them are awesome!</p>

            <p>Everything started on the 3<sup>rd</sup> of July when one of our friends 
            told us that he had adopted a dog and there were still other puppies
            without a home. At that moment, my husband and I looked at each other and
            immediately we knew that we wanted to adopt but were we prepared? 
            Those puppies were expected to grow medium size and we used to live in an 
            apartment which meant having several walks and patience to train him or her, 
            we also had to take into consideration all additional expenses 
            (i.e. dog food, toys, bed, vet services). </p>
            <p>Actually our decision was taken without thinking about anything other than
            our desire to have a puppy <em>(<b>ALERT:</b> This could have gone wrong!)</em>,
            so we immediately got in touch with this person and Koly came into our lives 5 days later.</p>
            <h3>Koly could not have arrived to our life at a better time!</h3>
